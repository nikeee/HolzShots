			],

			// Everything between two $ will be interpreted
			// There are multiple ways for interpreting stuff.
			// First, there is regex:
			//     $regex:n$
			//         Take the match of the nth entry in regexPatterns (zero-based).
			//     $regex:n:name$
			//          Same as $regex:n$, but takes only the contents of a capturing group.
			//     $regex:n:name:m$
			//          Same as above, but takes the mth match (again, zero-based), assuming there are multiple matches.
			// Then, you can use JSONPath if your response is JSON:
			//     $json:data.link$
			//          Takes the JSON path data.link
			// Everything that is not between two $ is just taken as is.
